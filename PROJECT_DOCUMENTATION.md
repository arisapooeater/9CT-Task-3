# Data Analysis Project Documentation
## Phase 1 : Identifying and Defining
### Mind Map
 ![Project Ideas Mind Map](./images/mind-map.png)

### Define Your Purpose
**Hypothesis :** Awareness of unethical practices in companies would reduce students' willingness to buy its products. However, when that company is popular or widely recognised, many would be more reluctant to refrain from buying these products even if they are unethically sourced.

### Requirements Outline
**Functional Requirements**

1. Data Loading: The system must be able to load .csv and .png files. When handling errors during file loading like incorrect format and missing files, the system should be able to report error messages(eg. File is missing).

2. Data Cleaning: System must be able to group same values(1-5) together.

3. Data Analysis: 

hat kind of statistical analysis does the system need to allow for (e.g. mean, median, mode)?

4. Data Visualisation: Data will need to be visualised in a grouped bar chart using Matplotlib.

5. Data Reporting: The system ahould include a table output where columns are responses 1-5 and rows are Questions 1 through 3. The final dataset needs to be stored in a .csv file.


**Non-Functional Requirements**

1. Speed : The system should not take a unreasonable amount of time to process/load (should be around ~5-20 seconds max)
2. Security : All data taken from students should be anonymous and not attached to any gmails. 
3. Reliability : Error messages should be clear, specific and informative(eg. Unsupported file format). Data used and displayed in this project/final reporting should also be accurate to student responses, and within established range(1-5).
4. Usability : The 'README' document needs to clear and concise in the purpose of the system and how to use it. The User Interface should be accessible, easy to navigate and comprehensible to viewers.


## Phase 2 : Researching and Planning
### Research Your Chosen Issue

### Discuss the findings

### Planning

## Phase 4 : Testing and Evaluating
### Analyse and Conclude
### Test Your Analysis

## Evaluation
**1. Evaluate your system and results in relation to your Requirements Outline**

**2. Evaluate your system in relation to peer feedback**

**3. Evaluate your project in relation to project management**

**4. Evaluate your system in relation to its data and security. Is the data valid, accurate and timely? Is it unbiased? Do we need to improve its security -- If so, how? Could the UX be more accessible -- how?**
